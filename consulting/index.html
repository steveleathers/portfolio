      <h2>Consulting</h2>
      <p>For over six years, I worked as a consultant at MIG, an urban planning, landscape architecture, and environmental science firm.</p>
      <p>When you work at a large firm for a long period of time and are excited by lots of things, your role tends to become less and less defined over time. I started out working strictly on GIS projects, until they found out I knew how websites worked. That transitioned into building email newsletters, working directly with clients, data science projects, and a whole lot of other types of work.</p>
      <p>All of this to say, six years of a career like this doesn't necessarily translate well to a resum&eacute;. So this is an attempt to discuss all of the things I've done as a consultant.</p>
