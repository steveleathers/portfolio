      <h2>Design Week Portland HQ</h2>

      <p>In December of 2015, I joined the Headquarters planning team at Design Week Portland. We built something really special.</p>
      <p>Over the course of several months, we created an idea for a space in Pioneer Square to interact with Design Week.</p>
      <img src="img/26195826243_a9a6aed428_k.jpg"/><br />
      <p>We did this by asking everyone what issues in Portland needed the most work. We asked them to take a tag with a specific topic, and write about what needed work. We then had them record their issue by dipping their tag into the "Issue Machine" which took a photo and recorded it for posterity. Finally, we asked them to affix it to one of nearly 50 posts with neighborhood names to spatialize the problem.</p>
      <p>We got nearly 700 responses. Housing was far and away the most touchy topic.</p>

      <p>After the week was over, we digitized the responses, analyzed them, and then compiled a report. You can read the report <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/95402499/DWP-HQ-report-2016.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
      <p>Eventually, Tsilli Pines and Kate Bingaman-Burt reported our results to City Council. </p>

      <p>For the most part, I think this project was a great success. However, on the last day, there was a lapse in security, and a person came on to the square and took a large number of tags off of their neighborhood posts.</p>
      <p><a href="files/DWPResults - Full List.csv" target="_blank">Here is the data</a> that we compiled, which lacks neighborhood names for many responses. And here is the <a href="files/dwpanalysis.R" target="_blank">R script</a> which I wrote to analyze the data. </p>
