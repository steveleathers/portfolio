NA	I strive for no separation, though am far from it.	MM	1400550469691

No	This is a big question for me. I am a designer, no doubt. But I'm unsure work can ever be enough play for me to fully self identify.	GB	0
Yes	I tell myself this because I want to feel like *everything* is a part of my creative practice. Otherwise, what's the point?	TC	0

No	I am my client's work. And they have horrible taste in architecture and design.	KSH	0

No	Here's the thing: people will forget everything about you except the way you made them feel. And we're lucky for that, because all those mistakes will be wiped away. Think about that as you're on your phone, as you're sending emails, as you are working	F	0
No	My work is just a sliver of what defines me. Yes I think through my work you can see bits of who I am. So maybe there really isn't a clear yes or no answer to this one.	KK	0
Yes	Designer that includes architecture, music, art, and people. Some a job, some hobbies, but all something I work on everyday since an early age.	DS	0
No	There are times in the past when I would have answered yes, but right now I'm just trading my time in this office for rent and food, hoping I can change my answer sometime soon. Even if I tried to mix up myself and my work now, I'd end up defeated by the tiers of thrashing middle-management between me and the world.	db	0
Yes	I am my work, I am what I create with others in this world; we all are. If you aren't your work, then you're probably just stuck in a job.	AQ	0

Yes	Half of me is my work; half of me is not. Half of my work is play, the other half is work. Half the work and half the play is half-assed; I am working on all of this.	LM	1400346568358
No	I am more than a server. I am more than bartender. I am more than a girl who is required to bend-over-backwards for ridiculous requests and less than 10% tips. I am an artist, a lover, and a singer. My job is to serve you, which is not who I am. It is just a means to an end.	CR	1400350611886
Yes	My work is an extension and expression of how I have lived, either chosen for me, or chosen by others, and who I strive to be today. Artist.	AM	1400353314530
No	I write for a living, and write poetry. 90% of my time is spent writing. But life comes first. I'm not my work. My work is me.	JM	1400354215923
Yes	forever my work / barely ever my job	ks	1400356077395

Yes	I feel driven to do the work I do, so it is an integral part of who I am. However, the older I get, my commitment to my work is increasingly (and problematically) framed as an excuse/reason for not having or wanting	id.	1400378585266
No	The field is not mine. When they talk about the future, I hope I'll be gone before it matters.	LEC	1400381349694
No	"Remember what they say: there's no shortcut to a dream. It's all blood and sweat, and life is what you manage in between." (Broken Bells, 2010)	EKG	1400400994668
Yes	Work is way larger than what's paid for, and the notion of being is an easy but incomplete way to describe the sum of one's actions.	DD	1400459940429
Yes	I feel like my work is me, I am my work. On the one hand this is great, I'm 'invested' in it. On the other hand, it's a problem. I have come to crave work I don't identify with so that I can reclaim non-work time for myself. The morphing of work and self has become oppressive, its separation can be liberating.	SH	1400600985310
No	Your works are various stages in your progression through life. Sometimes we change directions to do different work, but that doesn't make us fragmented.	HML	1401231167769
Yes	I am an interpretive vessel of everything that I know; I am what I know, and my work is me.	KB	1403769663759

Yes	yes, work is life is work. if you love your job, you would not even call it job.	sd	1405619558616
Yes	Because my work is super-duper important to me and is an expression of my individuality.	CFA	1406680248777
Yes	My work is a window to my heart, a sacred house, with many rooms. We are built of our passions. And even the things that get in the way, that don't seem to be ways of baring myself to the world, the daily interferences to these passions, they are part of me, and they are work too.	ALM	1407100243285
No	I'm not my work that makes me my money. I envy the people who say yes to this question, but because I say no I am always at odds with my home, with my body, with my loved ones, with my balance. I doubt I'll ever find work that makes me money and for which the answer to this question is yes, because it seems to me the only real tragedy of being alive is that we have to work for money until we are dead or else die at the hand of money.	DS	0
No	I don't have a job.	VW	0
